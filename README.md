# Rule-Based Chatbot using If-Else

This is a simple rule-based chatbot created using Python. It interacts with users by matching their input with predefined responses using basic `if-elif-else` logic.

## 🔍 Objective

To create a basic chatbot that responds to user input using simple conditional statements. This helps in understanding the foundational structure of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Programming Language:** Python 3

## 📁 Project Structure

- `chatbot.py` - Main script file that simulates the chatbot.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The chatbot continuously takes user input.
2. Based on specific keywords or phrases (like "hi", "how are you?", etc.), it gives predefined responses.
3. If the user types "bye", the chatbot ends the conversation.
4. For unknown inputs, it replies with a default message.

## 💬 Sample Interaction

You: hi
ChatBot: Hello! How can I help you?

You: how are you?
ChatBot: I’m good, thank you! What about you?

You: bye
ChatBot: Goodbye! Have a great day!


## 📌 Features

- Loop-based input/output system
- Uses basic if-elif-else conditions
- Responds to common greetings and queries
- Gracefully exits on "bye" or similar keywords

## 📘 Learning Outcome

- Understanding of input/output loops in Python
- Use of conditional statements for decision making
- Basic understanding of rule-based NLP

## 📝 Notes

- This project is built using only core Python, no external libraries.
- This is part of my Python internship at **BroskiesHub**.
- I have used 10 sample inputs to test different chatbot responses.

## 📦 Deliverables

- A Python script (`chatbot.py`) simulating the chatbot logic.
